i’m going through my pockets, i think i lost something
i don’t know when i dropped it, where do we begin

the small things fall softly, and you don’t feel them go
but you’re gonna hear it, the quiet always grows

caught in a loop, all day, always
caught in a loop, no light, no way
caught in a loop, all day, always
caught in a loop, we play, the game

the wheel keeps on spinning, but the thread pulls thin
tradin what we’re given, for the place we’re in
the season keeps on changin, but the hours don’t bend
and everything we’re handed, expected to expend

caught in a loop, all day, always
caught in a loop, no light, no way
caught in a loop, all day, always
caught in a loop, we play, the game

take a deep breath, this is such a good life
show some gratitude everything is just fine
discomfort means progress, embrace the unknown
the hustle is holy this pain is your own
optimize effort, not just your hours
every setback contains hidden powers
growth begins when excuses end
you have the same 24 hours as them, friend
trust in the process, results will appear
your dreams are just metrics you haven’t made clear
we’re all in this together, remember your why
align with the vision, and keep reaching high
no need for rest when you’re living your purpose
success is a service, and you are in service
your effort is valued, your future is fated
i will love you forever, not a minute wasted

*i will love you forever, not a minute wasted*
